* Privacy-first
* User-centric
* Community driven & fully open source

# Roadmap
This is a proposed roadmap. We value feedback from the community. If you think we should optimize the roadmap to match our Honest manifesto better, join our Telegram group and submit your proposals here: https://t.me/honest_cash.

### Basic functionality and registrations for early invitations
In the first stage, we'll open the platform to a limited group of people for testing purposes. We are currently working to make it happen. Users will be able to create content. Every post will have an Bitcoin Cash address that will allow others to give tips directly to the author of the content.

### Generation of a new wallet for tipping (instead of your own BCH addresses)
We will integrate with the Badget Wallet. It will allow users to create a new BCH address on signup or connect to an existing BCH wallet. This will allow to directly give tips to authors without using different wallet software.

### Incentivising upvotes for organic content promotion
In this stage every tip/upvote will also reward people who upvoted the content.

Game theorist Thomas Schelling developed the concept of Schelling Point (also known as Focal Points) as a solution that people tend to use to coordinate their behavior in the absence of communication, because it seems natural or relevant to them. Schelling illustrated the concept with the following example: “Tomorrow you have to meet a stranger in NYC. Where and when do you meet him?”. While any place and time in the city could be a solution, the most common answer is ”noon at the
information booth at Grand Central Terminal”. There is nothing that makes noon at Grand Central Terminal a location with a higher payoff (any other place and time would be good, provided that both agents coordinate there), but its tradition as a meeting place makes it a natural focal point. Schelling points typically arise when communication is impossible, but also when, while communication is possible, no party can provide the other with a reason to believe that what he says is true. Based on the concept of Schelling Points, we propose the an upvote systems that assumes that people will upvote good content because they will assume that others will follow by the same principle in an absense of communication.

### Users can log in with Bitcoin Cash. Email/Passwords authentificaion will be optional.
Up to this stage, participation will require a centralized login system. As next, we want to allow signup and creation of content without any need for an e-mail verification. This can be simply accomplished with a Bitcoin Cash signup.

### Content can optonally optionally saved on blockchain (or IPFS)
We strive for uncensorable content. Users will be able save its content on IPFS. We will provide decentralized repository of all content saved (for example as a smart contract). Besides, our technology is and will be open-sourced. This way in case we could not provide the service anymore (for whatever reason), other will be able to continue it without us.

There was one misconception about the definition of "uncesorable". We will not prohibit any opinion expressed on the platform or try to censor it. However, content that promotes rasism, crime, hate and similar will not be listed on the platform. Notwithstanding, the permissionless nature of the IPFS system does not stop the party to promote such content somewhere else.
